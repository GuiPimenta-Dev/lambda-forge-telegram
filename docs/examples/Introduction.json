Our methodology employs an incremental build strategy, where each new feature enhances the foundation laid by preceding projects, ensuring a cohesive and scalable architecture without duplicating efforts.\nTo keep our focus sharp on AWS resources and Lambda Forge architecture, we'll skip over the detailed discussion of unit and integration tests here. However, for those eager to dive deeper into testing methodologies, there is an insightful article called Effective Software Testing with Lambda Forge aimed at enriching your understanding about the subject.\nOur objective is to provide a streamlined and informative learning path, striking a balance between technical detail and approachability to keep you engaged without feeling overwhelmed.\nTo enhance usability and the overall user experience, we've implemented a custom domain, https://api.lambda-forge.com, making our URLs succinct and memorable across various deployment stages:\n\nDev - https://api.lambda-forge.com/dev\nStaging - https://api.lambda-forge.com/staging\nProd - https://api.lambda-forge.com\n\nFor those interested in customizing domain names within API Gateway, the How to Configure a Custom Domain Name for API Gateway guide offers a detailed tutorial on personalizing your project's URL.\nWith that being said, let's forge some Lambdas!\nforge project lambda-forge-examples --repo-owner \"$GITHUB-OWNER\" --repo-name \"$GITHUB-REPO\" --bucket \"$S3-BUCKET\"\n\nDocs: https://api.lambda-forge.com/docs.\nSource code: https://github.com/GuiPimenta-Dev/lambda-forge-examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u00a9 2024 Guilherme Alves Pimenta\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
