Our focus will be on the function named Staging-Lambda-Forge-Demo-HelloWorld.\n\nFirst, navigate to the function in question. Then, access Configurations -> Triggers to uncover the URL generated upon deployment.\n\nFor the purposes of our tutorial, the relevant URL is as follows:\n\nhttps://8kwcovaj0f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/staging/hello_world\n\nThe BASE URL, vital for API interactions, is identified as the URL segment before the /hello_world endpoint. For our example, it's:\nhttps://8kwcovaj0f.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/staging\nWith the base URL now in your possession, you're well-equipped to begin integrating your services, paving the way for seamless communication and functionality between your applications and the AWS infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u00a9 2024 Guilherme Alves Pimenta\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
