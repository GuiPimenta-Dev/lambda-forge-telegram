This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of setting up a custom domain name for your API Gateway in AWS.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following:\n\nAn AWS account.\nA deployed API in API Gateway.\nA registered domain name. You can use Amazon Route 53 or any other domain registrar.\nAn SSL certificate for your custom domain name in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). This is required for HTTPS.\n\nStep 1: Request a Certificate in AWS Certificate Manager\n\nGo to the AWS Certificate Manager: In the AWS Management Console, navigate to ACM.\nRequest a Certificate: Click on \u201cRequest a certificate\u201d and choose \u201cRequest a public certificate\u201d.\nAdd your domain names: Enter your custom domain name. You can add multiple names if needed.\nChoose validation method: You can validate your domain ownership via DNS or email. DNS validation is recommended for its simplicity and speed.\nReview and request: Review your details and click \u201cConfirm and request\u201d.\n\nStep 2: Validate Your Domain\n\nFor DNS Validation: Add the CNAME record provided by ACM to your DNS configuration. This process varies depending on your DNS provider.\nFor Email Validation: Check the email associated with your domain registration and follow the instructions in the email from AWS.\n\nStep 3: Create a Custom Domain Name in API Gateway\n\nNavigate to API Gateway: In the AWS Management Console, go to API Gateway.\nCreate Custom Domain Name: Click on \u201cCustom Domain Names\u201d in the sidebar, then \u201cCreate\u201d.\nConfigure your domain name: Enter your domain name and select the ACM certificate you created earlier.\nSet up Endpoint Configuration: Choose the endpoint type. You can choose from an \u201cEdge-optimized\u201d (default and recommended for global clients) or \u201cRegional\u201d (if your users are primarily in one region) endpoint.\nSave the Custom Domain Name: Click on \u201cSave\u201d to create your custom domain name.\n\nStep 4: Configure the Base Path Mapping\n\nSelect your custom domain name: From the list of custom domain names, click on the one you just created.\nCreate a new Base Path Mapping: Click on the \u201cBase Path Mappings\u201d section and then \u201cAdd new base path\u201d.\nSet up the Base Path: Choose the destination API and stage for your custom domain. The base path allows you to direct traffic to different APIs or stages from the same domain.\nSave your Base Path Mapping: Click on \u201cSave\u201d.\n\nStep 5: Update Your DNS Records\n\nGet the API Gateway domain name: After saving your custom domain name in API Gateway, you'll get a target domain name. This is different from your custom domain.\nCreate a CNAME record: In your domain\u2019s DNS settings, create a CNAME record pointing your custom domain to the target domain name provided by API Gateway.\n\nStep 6: Test Your Custom Domain\n\nAfter your DNS changes propagate, test your custom domain by sending requests to your API through the new domain name.\n\nConclusion\nYou have successfully configured a custom domain name for your API Gateway. This not only enhances your API's branding but also provides a more secure and professional way to present your services to the world.\nIf you encounter any issues, AWS documentation and support forums are great resources for troubleshooting and getting additional help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Back to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \u00a9 2024 Guilherme Alves Pimenta\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
