Execute the following commands to install the AWS CDK globally and set up your AWS credentials:\nnpm install -g aws-cdk\naws configure\ncdk bootstrap\n\nDuring the configuration, you will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region name, and output format.\nCreate a GitHub Personal Access Token\nLambda Forge uses CodePipeline to interact with your GitHub repository. To enable this, generate a GitHub personal access token by following these steps:\n\nNavigate to \"Developer Settings\" in your GitHub account.\nSelect \"Personal access tokens,\" then \"Tokens (classic).\"\nClick \"Generate new token,\" ensuring the \"repo\" scope is selected for full control of private repositories.\nComplete the token generation process.\n\nYou can find more informations about creating a GitHub Token here.\nYour token will follow this format: ghp_********************************\nStore the Token on AWS Secrets Manager\nSave this token in AWS Secrets Manager as plain text using the exact name github-token. This specific naming is vital as it corresponds to the default identifier that the CDK looks for within your AWS account.\nCreate a New Directory\nmkdir lambda_forge_demo\ncd lambda_forge_demo\n\nCreate a New Virtual Environment\npython3 -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate\n\nInstall lambda-forge\npip install lambda-forge --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/\n\nForge CLI\nThe Forge Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful, versatile tool designed to streamline the development, deployment, and management of applications. It enables developers to automate repetitive tasks, manage project configurations, and interact directly with the services and infrastructure without leaving the terminal. This CLI tool simplifies complex processes through straightforward commands, significantly reducing development time and effort.\nVerify Installation\nHaving successfully installed Lambda Forge, you are now ready to explore the capabilities of the Forge CLI. Begin by entering the following command to access the comprehensive list of available options and commands:\nforge --help\n\nHere's a concise list of the commands supported by Forge:\nCommands:\n  authorizer  Create a new authorizer\n  function    Create a new function\n  layer       Create a new layer\n  project     Create a new project\n  service     Create a new AWS service\n\nFor a comprehensive list of configurations that each Forge command supports, you can refer to the command line help by running:\nforge $COMMAND --help.\nLater in this tutorial, we'll delve into the specifics of each command. But for now, let's kickstart by establishing the foundation of our project.\nCreate a New Project\nStart a new project named lambda-forge-demo, incorporating the --no-docs flag to bypass docs generation initially as this will be covered on a dedicated section.\nforge project lambda-forge-demo --repo-owner \"$GITHUB-OWNER\" --repo-name \"$GITHUB-REPO\" --no-docs\n\nMake sure to replace $GITHUB-OWNER and $GITHUB-REPO with the actual GitHub owner and the name of an empty repository.\nProject Structure\nUpon creatig your project, some directories and files are automatically generated for you. This initial structure is designed to streamline the setup process and provide a solid foundation for further development.\nIn the upcoming sections of this tutorial, we'll explore each of these components in detail. For now, familiarize yourself with the foundational structure that should resemble the following:\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 authorizers\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 functions\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 infra\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 services\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 api_gateway.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 aws_lambda.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 layers.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 stacks\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 dev_stack.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 lambda_stack.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 prod_stack.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 staging_stack.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stages\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 deploy.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 layers\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .coveragerc\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cdk.json\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pytest.ini\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\nThe cdk.json file, located at the root of your directory, serves as the central configuration hub for Lambda Forge projects.
